    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        To make a classic lasagna, start by preparing a rich meat sauce.
        Sauté one chopped onion and a few minced garlic cloves in olive oil until softened, then add about 1.5 pounds of ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork).
        Cook until browned, drain any excess fat, and stir in a large can (28 oz) of crushed tomatoes, a few tablespoons of tomato paste, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and a pinch of sugar.
        Let the sauce simmer for 30-45 minutes to develop flavor.
        Meanwhile, boil lasagna noodles according to package instructions (or use no-boil noodles for convenience).
        For the cheese mixture, combine 15 oz of ricotta cheese with one beaten egg, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan, salt, pepper, and a handful of chopped parsley.
    </p>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
        In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce, then layer noodles, ricotta mixture, sauce, and shredded mozzarella cheese.
        Repeat the layers until the ingredients are used up, finishing with a generous layer of sauce and mozzarella on top.
        Cover the dish with foil (lightly greased so it doesn't stick to the cheese) and bake for 25 minutes, then uncover and bake for another 20 minutes until bubbly and golden.
        Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing to help it hold together. Serve warm, with a side salad and garlic bread if desired.
